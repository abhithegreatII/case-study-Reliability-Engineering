# case-study-Reliability-Engineering
According to reliability tests and regression curves, we consult an imaginary company on what material should be used.
An existing shiny.js app is modified to include new tabs and our data and graphs.

## The Solution
A company that creates paperclips needs consultancy on which materials should be used for their new paperclips.
We test and collect data on the two different materials. Based on the Kaplan Meier estimator, the reliability of the materials was calculated and visualized in the shiny.js app.
